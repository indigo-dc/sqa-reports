        - "Points to improve in the documentation: \\begin{itemize} \\item Question NOT RELATED to the doc: LSF is a proprietary batch system and INDIGO develops open source solutions, will this product support open source schedulers (eg SLURM, Torque, SoGE, etc) ? \\item Deployment guide: \\begin{itemize} \\item Installation using packages: address the installation using the INDIGO-1 repository. \\item Builiding from source should be added as well. The configuration described involves compiling code ? \\item In \\textit{cloud deployment} section: table \\textit{Section[batch\\_submitter]} has no description \\item How are the physical machines (CN, WN) configured and installed? What services must be running? \\end{itemize} \\item Developer guide: add a note on how to contribute. \\end{itemize}"
