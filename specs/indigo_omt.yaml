        - "By the product team: \\textit{Ansible in context of mobile app is in my opinion not so crucial service like for other services in this project (The very similar example is Docker in conjuction with mobile app.). Ansible can only prepare the enviroment for development but the mobile app needs to be deployed on the real device using USB/Google Play or using emulator, so in the cloud env could be very tricky. Anyway, I tried to force the up-to-date jenkins instance to run latest and few older emulators, but without luck yet.}."
