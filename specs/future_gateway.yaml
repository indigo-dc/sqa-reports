This must be completed to cover installation using INDIGO repository. \\item There is a typo in the URL pointed at wget https://github.com/FutureGateway/PortalSetup/raw/master/Ubuntui\\_14.04/fgSetup.sh \\item what is the usefulness of the fgTools to the user communities and/or site admins ? how and when to use them ? \\item TCP ports that need to be exposed and to which services \\end{itemize} \\item User guide \\begin{itemize} \\item How to register and manage users ? \\item How to define the universe of resources available to execute the tasks and their properties \\item What does it mean GridEngine? is the SGE batch system or is an engine to submit to grid sites ? \\item Where is the documentation about the adaptors? add pointers to the docs. \\end{itemize} \\item Regarding PortalSetup \\begin{itemize} \\item Not clear if it works with CentOS7 (\\textit{EL6/7 Tested with CentOS6}) and directory CentOS7 is not there (\\textit{Please notice that OS specific intallation scripts are collected inside dedicated directories.}) \\item Rephrase \\textit{Debian Tested with Ubuntu} statement. \\end{itemize} \\end{itemize}"
