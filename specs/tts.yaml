    description:
        - parsing the configuration files
        - fetching configuration from OpenId Connect Provider and parsing them
        - returning the list of supported provider
        - authenticating a rest user by a token (the actual verification of the token is mocked, as the TTS can't create valid tokens)
        - returning a list of configured servcices
        - requesting a credintial for one service, including executing the plugin and tracking its state
        - revoking the previous created token
        - ensuring no token is left after revocation
        - all test steps are performed using the tts rest client, which itself is also validated
